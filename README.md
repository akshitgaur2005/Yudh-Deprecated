Although the project was slated to use Godot, learning it and making a few quick and dirty projects revealed that I was not really satisfied with the granularity and control Godot provides, this is just a personal choice as Godot is actually more than powerful enough to create such a project as can be seen by the number of awesome things built with it.

Regardless, I have decided to try out Bevy and Rust next!
